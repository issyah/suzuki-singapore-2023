      Based on the analysis technology of torsion, longitudinal direction, and lateral direction, the frame is compatible with high rigidity and lightweight. The steel-tube frame is light and the rigidity is intensified by adjusting the position of suspension. Thanks to the sophisticated balance, GSX-R150 is compatible with stability and superior maneuverability inherited from GSX-R.
