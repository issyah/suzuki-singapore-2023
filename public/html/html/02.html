      To achieve high power output, large diameter exhaust pipe is adopted, on the other hand, the compatibility of the speed range of high and low rpms are achieved by expanding the pipe diameter from the middle of the pipe. Moreover, exciting exhaust sound is achieved by making the 2 different end pipes. A catalytic converter helps the GSX-R150 meet the Euro3 emission standards.
